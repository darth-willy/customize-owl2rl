# customize-owl2rl
A web service to create custom OWL2 RL rulesets, applying a series of optimizations and/or n-ary list solutions.

In the file `www/js/webservice.js`, you can find examples on how to perform "default selection", "domain-based selection" and "preprocessing" (i.e., n-ary rules). 

Just run the web service (configure its URL in `config.js`) and open the `www/webservice.html` file in your favourite browser. Any errors returned by the service will be shown in the JS console.
